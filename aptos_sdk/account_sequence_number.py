Account sequence number management for the Aptos Python SDK.

This module provides thread-safe, asynchronous management of account sequence numbers
for transaction submission. It implements flow control mechanisms to prevent
mempool overflow and ensures proper transaction ordering.

Key features:
- Concurrent sequence number allocation with proper synchronization
- Automatic mempool flow control (max 100 transactions in flight per account)
- Timeout-based recovery from stuck transactions
- Thread-safe operations using asyncio locks
- Network state synchronization

The sequence number management follows the flow control pattern used by the
Aptos faucet to handle high-throughput transaction submission while respecting
mempool limits.

Examples:
    Basic sequence number management::

        from aptos_sdk.async_client import RestClient
        from aptos_sdk.account_address import AccountAddress
        from aptos_sdk.account_sequence_number import AccountSequenceNumber

        # Create client and sequence manager
        client = RestClient("https://fullnode.devnet.aptoslabs.com/v1")
        account_addr = AccountAddress.from_str("0x123...")
        seq_manager = AccountSequenceNumber(client, account_addr)

        # Get next sequence number for transaction
        seq_num = await seq_manager.next_sequence_number()

        # Submit transaction with seq_num...

        # Wait for all pending transactions to complete
        await seq_manager.synchronize()

    High-throughput transaction submission::

        # Submit multiple transactions concurrently
        tasks = []
        for i in range(50):
            seq_num = await seq_manager.next_sequence_number()
            task = submit_transaction_with_sequence(seq_num)
            tasks.append(task)

        # Wait for all transactions
        await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
        await seq_manager.synchronize()

    Custom configuration::

        from aptos_sdk.account_sequence_number import AccountSequenceNumberConfig

        # Custom flow control settings
        config = AccountSequenceNumberConfig()
        config.maximum_in_flight = 50  # Lower concurrency
        config.maximum_wait_time = 60  # Longer timeout
        config.sleep_time = 0.05      # Less aggressive polling

        seq_manager = AccountSequenceNumber(client, account_addr, config)

    This class defines the flow control parameters used by AccountSequenceNumber

    Attributes:
        maximum_in_flight: Maximum number of unconfirmed transactions allowed
            per account (default: 100). This matches Aptos mempool limits.
        maximum_wait_time: Maximum seconds to wait for transaction confirmation
            before forcing a resync (default: 30).
        sleep_time: Seconds to sleep between network polls when waiting
            (default: 0.01).

class AccountSequenceNumber:
    """Thread-safe sequence number manager for high-throughput transaction submission.

    This class manages sequence number allocation for an Aptos account with built-in
    flow control to prevent mempool overflow. It implements the same strategy used
    by the Aptos faucet for reliable high-volume transaction processing.

    Flow Control Strategy:
    - Allows up to 100 transactions in flight simultaneously (configurable)
    - Monitors network state to track transaction confirmations
    - Implements automatic backoff when mempool capacity is reached
    - Provides timeout-based recovery for stuck transactions
    - Ensures FIFO ordering of sequence number allocation

    Key Features:
    - **Concurrency Safe**: Multiple async tasks can safely request sequence numbers
    - **Automatic Initialization**: Syncs with on-chain state on first use
    - **Flow Control**: Respects mempool limits to prevent rejection
    - **Recovery Mechanisms**: Handles network issues and stuck transactions
    - **Ordering Guarantees**: FIFO sequence number allocation via async locks

    Attributes:
        _client: REST client for network communication
        _account: The account address being managed
        _lock: Async lock ensuring thread safety
        _maximum_in_flight: Max unconfirmed transactions (default 100)
        _maximum_wait_time: Timeout for transaction confirmation (default 30s)
        _sleep_time: Polling interval during waits (default 0.01s)
        _last_committed_number: Last confirmed on-chain sequence number
        _current_number: Next sequence number to allocate
        _initialized: Whether the manager has been initialized

    Important Assumptions:
    - Each account should be managed by exactly one AccountSequenceNumber instance
    - The account should not be used for manual transaction submission while managed
    - Network connectivity is generally stable (handles temporary failures)
    - Transactions eventually confirm or fail (not permanently stuck)

    Usage Guidelines:
    - Call synchronize() after transaction failures to reset state
    - Use non-blocking mode (block=False) to check availability without waiting
    - Monitor logs for timeout warnings indicating potential issues
    - Configure parameters based on network conditions and requirements

    Examples:
        Basic usage::

            seq_manager = AccountSequenceNumber(client, account_address)

            # Get next sequence number
            seq_num = await seq_manager.next_sequence_number()

            # Submit transaction...

            # Wait for completion
            await seq_manager.synchronize()

        High-throughput submission::

            # Submit 50 transactions concurrently
            tasks = []
            for i in range(50):
                seq_num = await seq_manager.next_sequence_number()
                task = submit_transaction(seq_num)
                tasks.append(task)

            await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
            await seq_manager.synchronize()

        Error handling::

            try:
                seq_num = await seq_manager.next_sequence_number(block=False)
                if seq_num is None:
                    print("Too many transactions in flight, try later")
                    return

                # Submit transaction...

                # Reset state after errors
                await seq_manager.synchronize()
                raise

    Warning:
        Do not use the same account with multiple AccountSequenceNumber instances
        simultaneously, as this will lead to sequence number conflicts and transaction
        failures.
