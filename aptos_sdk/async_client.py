"""
Asynchronous client library for interacting with the Aptos blockchain.

This module provides comprehensive async client implementations for connecting to and
interacting with Aptos full nodes, faucet services, and indexer services. It supports
the full range of Aptos blockchain operations including account management, transaction
submission, resource queries, and event monitoring.

Key Features:
- **RestClient**: Full-featured async client for Aptos REST API
- **IndexerClient**: GraphQL client for querying indexed blockchain data
- **FaucetClient**: Client for test network coin funding operations
- **BCS Support**: Binary Canonical Serialization for efficient data handling
- **Multi-Agent Transactions**: Support for complex multi-signature scenarios
- **Transaction Simulation**: Gas estimation and execution preview
- **Event Monitoring**: Real-time blockchain event querying
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception hierarchy for API errors

Client Types:
    RestClient: Primary interface to Aptos full nodes via REST API
    IndexerClient: GraphQL interface to Aptos indexer services
    FaucetClient: Test network funding and account creation

Transaction Types:
    - Single-agent transactions (standard transfers, function calls)
    - Multi-agent transactions (requiring multiple signatures)
    - View function calls (read-only operations)
    - BCS-encoded transactions (efficient binary format)

Query Capabilities:
    - Account information (balance, sequence number, resources)
    - Transaction history and status
    - Blockchain events and logs
    - Move module and resource data
    - Table lookups and aggregator values
    - Block and ledger information

Examples:
    Basic client setup and account query::

        from aptos_sdk.async_client import RestClient, ClientConfig
        from aptos_sdk.account_address import AccountAddress

        # Create client with custom configuration
        config = ClientConfig(
            max_gas_amount=200_000,
            gas_unit_price=150,
            transaction_wait_in_seconds=30
        )

        client = RestClient("https://fullnode.devnet.aptoslabs.com/v1", config)

        # Query account information
        address = AccountAddress.from_str("0x123...")
        account_info = await client.account(address)
        balance = await client.account_balance(address)

        print(f"Sequence number: {account_info['sequence_number']}")
        print(f"Balance: {balance} octas")

        await client.close()

    Transaction submission::

        from aptos_sdk.account import Account

        # Create sender account
        sender = Account.generate()
        recipient = AccountAddress.from_str("0x456...")

        # Transfer 1 APT (1 * 10^8 octas)
        txn_hash = await client.bcs_transfer(
            sender=sender,
            recipient=recipient,
            amount=100_000_000  # 1 APT in octas
        )

        # Wait for transaction completion
        await client.wait_for_transaction(txn_hash)
        txn_info = await client.transaction_by_hash(txn_hash)

    Multi-agent transaction::

        # Create multi-agent transaction requiring multiple signatures
        signed_txn = await client.create_multi_agent_bcs_transaction(
            sender=primary_account,
            secondary_accounts=[account2, account3],
            payload=transaction_payload
        )

        txn_hash = await client.submit_bcs_transaction(signed_txn)

    IndexerClient usage::

        indexer = IndexerClient(
            "https://indexer.devnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/graphql",
            bearer_token="optional_token"
        )

        # GraphQL query example
        query = \"\"\"
        query GetTransactions($address: String!) {
            account_transactions(where: {account_address: {_eq: $address}}) {
                transaction_version
                transaction_timestamp
                success
            }
        }
        \"\"\"

        result = await indexer.query(query, {"address": str(address)})

    Faucet usage for testnet::

        faucet = FaucetClient(
            "https://faucet.devnet.aptoslabs.com",
            rest_client=client
        )

        # Fund account with test coins
        account = Account.generate()
        txn_hash = await faucet.fund_account(
            address=account.address(),
            amount=500_000_000  # 5 APT
        )

        await faucet.close()

Error Handling:
    The module provides specific exception types for different error scenarios:

    - ApiError: General API request failures (HTTP 4xx/5xx)
    - AccountNotFound: Requested account doesn't exist
    - ResourceNotFound: Requested resource not found in account

Best Practices:
    - Always call client.close() when done to clean up connections
    - Use context managers or try/finally blocks for resource cleanup
    - Configure appropriate timeouts for your use case
    - Handle specific exceptions (AccountNotFound, ResourceNotFound) when expected
    - Use BCS transactions for better performance and lower fees
    - Implement retry logic for transient network errors
    - Cache chain ID and other static values when making many requests

Note:
    All client operations are async and must be awaited. The clients use httpx
    for HTTP/2 support and connection pooling for optimal performance.

class ClientConfig:
    """Configuration parameters for Aptos REST API clients.

    This class encapsulates common settings used by REST clients for transaction
    submission, gas management, and network communication. These parameters affect
    transaction costs, execution timeouts, and API authentication.

    Transaction Parameters:
        expiration_ttl: Time-to-live for transactions in seconds (default: 600)
        gas_unit_price: Price per unit of gas in octas (default: 100)
        max_gas_amount: Maximum gas units allowed per transaction (default: 100,000)
        transaction_wait_in_seconds: Timeout for transaction confirmation (default: 20)

    Network Parameters:
        http2: Enable HTTP/2 for better performance (default: True)
        api_key: Optional API key for authenticated requests (default: None)

    Examples:
        Default configuration::

            config = ClientConfig()
            client = RestClient(node_url, config)

        High-throughput configuration::

            config = ClientConfig(
                gas_unit_price=150,       # Higher gas price for faster processing
                max_gas_amount=200_000,   # Higher gas limit for complex transactions
                transaction_wait_in_seconds=60,  # Longer wait for busy networks
                expiration_ttl=300        # Shorter expiration for high-frequency ops

        Conservative settings::

            config = ClientConfig(
                gas_unit_price=100,       # Standard gas price
                max_gas_amount=50_000,    # Lower gas limit to prevent runaway
                expiration_ttl=1200       # Longer expiration for manual workflows
            )

    Notes:
        - Gas prices may need adjustment based on network congestion
        - Higher gas limits allow more complex transactions but cost more
        - HTTP/2 is recommended for better connection reuse and performance
        - API keys are required for some premium or rate-limited services
        - Transaction expiration prevents stale transactions from executing

    Error Handling:
        The client raises specific exceptions for different failure modes:
        - ApiError: HTTP errors (4xx, 5xx status codes)
        - AccountNotFound: Account doesn't exist on-chain
        - ResourceNotFound: Requested resource not found in account

    Best Practices:
        - Always call await client.close() when done
        - Use try/finally or async context managers for cleanup
        - Cache chain_id() result for better performance
        - Configure appropriate gas limits for your transactions
        - Implement exponential backoff for retries on failures
        - Use BCS transactions for better performance and fees
        - Monitor gas usage and adjust pricing as needed

    Note:
        This client is designed for production use with proper connection
        management, timeout handling, and error recovery. It supports both
        mainnet and testnet environments.
