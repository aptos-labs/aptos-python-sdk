class Account:
    """Represents a complete Aptos blockchain account with cryptographic key management.

    The Account class encapsulates the fundamental components needed to interact with
    the Aptos blockchain: an account address and its associated private key. It provides
    comprehensive functionality for account creation, transaction signing, key management,
    and persistent storage.

    Key Features:
    - **Multiple Key Types**: Supports Ed25519 and Secp256k1 ECDSA cryptographic schemes
    - **Random Generation**: Secure random account creation with proper entropy
    - **Key Import/Export**: Load accounts from hex strings or JSON files
    - **Transaction Signing**: Sign transactions and arbitrary data
    - **Address Derivation**: Automatic address calculation from public keys
    - **Persistence**: Save and load account data to/from files
    - **Authentication**: Generate authentication keys and proof challenges

    Cryptographic Support:
    - **Ed25519**: Default signature scheme, fast and secure
    - **Secp256k1 ECDSA**: Ethereum-compatible signatures for interoperability
    - **Multi-key**: Support for threshold and multi-signature schemes

    Examples:
        Create a new account::

            from aptos_sdk.account import Account

            # Generate new Ed25519 account
            account = Account.generate()
            print(f"Address: {account.address()}")
            print(f"Private key: {account.private_key}")

        Create Secp256k1 account::

            # Generate Secp256k1 ECDSA account (Ethereum-compatible)
            secp_account = Account.generate_secp256k1_ecdsa()
            print(f"Secp256k1 address: {secp_account.address()}")

        Load existing account::

            # From hex private key
            hex_key = "0x1234567890abcdef..."
            imported_account = Account.load_key(hex_key)

            # From JSON file
            saved_account = Account.load("./my_account.json")

        Sign transactions::

            from aptos_sdk.async_client import RestClient

            async def transfer_tokens():
                client = RestClient("https://fullnode.devnet.aptoslabs.com/v1")

                # Create transfer transaction
                recipient = Account.generate().address()
                txn_hash = await client.transfer(account, recipient, 1000)

                # Wait for completion
                result = await client.wait_for_transaction(txn_hash)
                print(f"Transfer successful: {result['success']}")

        Persistent storage::

            # Save account to file
            account.store("./wallet.json")

            # Load account later
            restored_account = Account.load("./wallet.json")
            assert account == restored_account

        Sign arbitrary data::

            # Sign custom message
            message = b"Hello, Aptos!"
            signature = account.sign(message)

            # Verify signature
            public_key = account.public_key()
            is_valid = public_key.verify(message, signature)
            print(f"Signature valid: {is_valid}")

    Security Considerations:
    - **Private Key Protection**: Never expose private keys in logs or UI
    - **Secure Storage**: Use encrypted storage for production private keys
    - **Key Rotation**: Consider implementing key rotation for long-lived accounts
    - **Testnet First**: Always test on devnet/testnet before mainnet deployment
    - **Entropy**: The random generation uses cryptographically secure random sources

    Note:
        Account addresses are derived deterministically from public keys using
        SHA3-256 hashing. The same private key will always generate the same
        address across different SDK instances.

            - **Enterprise Integration**: Systems already using Secp256k1

        Performance Considerations:
            - Secp256k1 signatures are larger than Ed25519 (64 vs 32 bytes)
            - Ed25519 has faster verification times
            - Secp256k1 has wider hardware support
