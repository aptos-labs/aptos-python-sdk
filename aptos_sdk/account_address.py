"""
Account address management for the Aptos blockchain.

This module provides comprehensive support for managing account addresses on the Aptos
blockchain, including address parsing, validation, derivation, and formatting according
to the AIP-40 address standard.

Key features:
- AIP-40 compliant address parsing and formatting
- Address derivation from public keys and seeds
- Support for special address formats
- Resource account and named object address generation
- Strict and relaxed parsing modes

The module implements the Aptos address standard defined in AIP-40, which specifies
that addresses should be represented in either LONG form (64 hex characters) or
SHORT form for special addresses (addresses 0x0 through 0xf).

Examples:
    Basic address operations::

        # Parse from string (strict)
        addr = AccountAddress.from_str("0x1")

        # Parse from string (relaxed)
        addr = AccountAddress.from_str_relaxed("1")

        # Derive from public key
        addr = AccountAddress.from_key(public_key)

    Special address handling::

        # Special addresses use SHORT form
        special_addr = AccountAddress.from_str("0xa")
        print(special_addr)  # "0xa"

        # Non-special addresses use LONG form
        regular_addr = AccountAddress.from_str(
            "0x0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef"
        )

    Resource and object addresses::

        # Create resource account address
        resource_addr = AccountAddress.for_resource_account(
            creator_address, b"seed"
        )

        # Create named object address
        object_addr = AccountAddress.for_named_object(
            creator_address, b"object_name"
        )

        # Create token collection address
        collection_addr = AccountAddress.for_named_collection(
            creator_address, "My Collection"
        )
