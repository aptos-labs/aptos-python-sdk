class TransactionWorker:
    """High-throughput transaction processing framework for Aptos blockchain.
    
    The TransactionWorker provides an asynchronous framework for processing large volumes
    of transactions efficiently. It manages sequence number coordination, transaction
    generation, submission, and result tracking through separate concurrent tasks.
    
    Architecture:
    - **Sequence Management**: Automatically acquires sequential transaction numbers
    - **Concurrent Submission**: Submits transactions asynchronously for high throughput
    - **Batch Processing**: Processes transaction results in batches for efficiency
    - **Error Handling**: Captures and reports transaction submission errors
    - **Queue-Based**: Uses asyncio queues for task coordination
    
    Key Features:
    - **High Performance**: Designed for bulk transaction processing
    - **Sequence Safety**: Ensures proper transaction ordering
    - **Non-blocking**: Asynchronous operation doesn't block the caller
    - **Error Tracking**: Comprehensive error reporting and exception handling
    - **Result Monitoring**: Track transaction outcomes and failures
    
    Workflow:
    1. **Start**: Initialize worker tasks for submission and processing
    2. **Generate**: Transaction generator creates signed transactions with sequence numbers
    3. **Submit**: Submit transactions to the blockchain via REST client
    4. **Track**: Monitor submission results and errors
    5. **Process**: Batch process results for efficiency
    6. **Stop**: Clean shutdown of worker tasks
    
    Examples:
        Basic transaction worker::
        
            import asyncio
            from aptos_sdk.async_client import RestClient
            from aptos_sdk.account import Account
            from aptos_sdk.transaction_worker import TransactionWorker
            
            async def transaction_generator(account, sequence_number):
                # Create transfer transaction
                recipient = Account.generate().address()
                return await client.create_bcs_signed_transaction(
                    account, transfer_payload, sequence_number=sequence_number
                )
            
            async def bulk_transfers():
                client = RestClient("https://fullnode.devnet.aptoslabs.com/v1")
                sender = Account.generate()
                
                # Create and start worker
                worker = TransactionWorker(sender, client, transaction_generator)
                worker.start()
                
                try:
                    # Process transaction results
                    for _ in range(100):  # Process 100 transactions
                        seq_num, tx_hash, error = await worker.next_processed_transaction()
                        if error:
                            print(f"Transaction {seq_num} failed: {error}")
                        else:
                            print(f"Transaction {seq_num} succeeded: {tx_hash}")
                finally:
                    worker.stop()
                    
        Token distribution example::
        
            async def token_generator(account, sequence_number):
                # Distribute tokens to random recipients
                recipients = [Account.generate().address() for _ in range(10)]
                recipient = random.choice(recipients)
                
                return await client.transfer_transaction(
                    account, recipient, 1000, sequence_number=sequence_number
                )
                
            # Process 1000 token distributions
            worker = TransactionWorker(distributor_account, client, token_generator)
            worker.start()
            
            success_count = 0
            for _ in range(1000):
                seq_num, tx_hash, error = await worker.next_processed_transaction()
                if not error:
                    success_count += 1
                    
            print(f"Successfully distributed tokens in {success_count} transactions")
            worker.stop()
    
    Performance Considerations:
    - **Batch Size**: Processes multiple transactions concurrently
    - **Memory Usage**: Queues consume memory; monitor for large workloads
    - **Network Limits**: Respects node rate limits and connection pooling
    - **Sequence Coordination**: May wait for sequence numbers under high load
    
    Limitations:
    - **No Retry Logic**: Failed transactions are not automatically retried
    - **No Health Monitoring**: Doesn't check node health or connectivity
    - **Basic Error Handling**: Errors are reported but not automatically resolved
    - **Single Account**: Designed for single account use (sequence number coordination)
    
    Error Handling:
        Transaction errors are captured and reported through the result queue.
        Common error scenarios:
        - Network connectivity issues
        - Insufficient account balance
        - Transaction validation failures
        - Node overload or rate limiting
    
    Thread Safety:
        The TransactionWorker is designed for single-threaded async use.
        Don't share instances across multiple async contexts.
    
    Note:
        This is a basic framework suitable for development and testing.
        Production systems should implement additional features like:
        - Retry logic with exponential backoff
        - Health monitoring and circuit breakers
        - Metrics collection and monitoring
        - Graceful degradation strategies

        Background Tasks:
            Starting the worker creates two background tasks:
            - **Submission Task**: Generates and submits transactions
            - **Processing Task**: Processes submission results in batches
        
        Note:
            The worker must be started before calling next_processed_transaction().
            Always pair start() with stop() for proper resource cleanup.

class TransactionQueue:
    """Queue-based transaction payload manager for TransactionWorker integration.
    
    The TransactionQueue provides a simple interface for feeding transaction payloads
    to a TransactionWorker. It acts as a bridge between application logic that creates
    transaction payloads and the worker that needs signed transactions.
    
    Key Features:
    - **Async Queue**: Built on asyncio.Queue for efficient async operations
    - **Payload Management**: Handles raw transaction payloads before signing
    - **Worker Integration**: Designed to work seamlessly with TransactionWorker
    - **Backpressure**: Built-in flow control through queue size limits
    
    Examples:
        Basic queue usage::
        
            from aptos_sdk.transaction_worker import TransactionQueue
            from aptos_sdk.transactions import EntryFunction, TransactionArgument
            
            # Create queue and connect to worker
            queue = TransactionQueue(rest_client)
            worker = TransactionWorker(account, rest_client, queue.next)
            
            # Push transaction payloads
            transfer_payload = EntryFunction.natural(
                "***::aptos_account",
                "transfer",
                [],
                [recipient_address, amount]
            )
            
            await queue.push(transfer_payload)
            
        Batch operations::
        
            # Push multiple payloads
            payloads = [
                create_transfer_payload(addr, 1000)
                for addr in recipient_addresses
            ]
            
            for payload in payloads:
                await queue.push(payload)
                
            # Worker will process them automatically
            
        Custom payload generation::
        
            async def generate_payloads():
                for i in range(1000):
                    payload = create_custom_payload(i)
                    await queue.push(payload)
                    
            # Start payload generation and worker processing
            asyncio.create_task(generate_payloads())
            worker.start()
    
    Integration Pattern:
        The typical usage pattern is:
        1. Create TransactionQueue with REST client
        2. Create TransactionWorker with account and queue.next as generator
        3. Push payloads to queue with push()
        4. Worker automatically consumes payloads and creates signed transactions
    
    Note:
        The queue uses unbounded storage by default. For high-volume applications,
        consider implementing backpressure or queue size limits to prevent
        memory exhaustion.
